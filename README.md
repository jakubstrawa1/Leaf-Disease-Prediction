Here's a project that i built with TensorFlow. The model predicts whether a leaf has some disease or not. It was built using 900 photos of plants with bacterias or some other diseases.

I've learned a lot coding this project. I'm completely hooked on OpenCV and TensorFlow as well as ScikitLearn now. Pretty sure i'm gonna improve upon this code in the nearest future.
